## Welcome to My Project Page

Hello, my name is James. I am currently completing my final term to obtain my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. For my final capstone, I am converting a code base previously written by me in C++ into Python. This code is a program that parses a CSV file and provides the options to load the file, display all each row of data, find a specific entry based on a unique ID number, and remove a bid. Not only will I be converting the code into Python, but I will be adding additional features along with a MongoDB database.

Please visit the repository page to view the current state of the project.
